# Raspberry Pi API and Backend

This directory is the home for the mobile-facing API layer and its API-specific documentation/tests. It is a **component-owned location**, not a separate copy of the robot application.

## Ownership

- **Vishal Raj:** API routes, REST request/response handling, WebSocket endpoint integration, API validation, API tests, and contract documentation.
- **Tharun:** hardware and ESP32 behavior; approve hardware-facing safety/protocol decisions with Vishal.
- **Niteshvar:** Flutter client integration; coordinate any mobile-facing contract changes with him.

## Boundary

- The API must call the existing Pi robot/service layer rather than implementing motor, GPIO, sensor-driver, or ESP32 timing logic itself.
- Flutter talks to the Pi API, never directly to the ESP32.
- REST is for request/response operations; WebSocket is for live telemetry, according to the approved contracts.
- Do not invent endpoints, payload fields, status enums, authentication behavior, or protocol messages. Add them only after the team approves and documents the contract.
- Never add an unrestricted shell-command endpoint or bypass robot-side safety.

## Suggested organization

Add subfolders only when the implementation requires them. For example:

```text
api/
├── README.md
├── routes/          # HTTP routes, if the selected framework needs this separation
├── websocket/       # WebSocket handlers, if separate modules are warranted
├── schemas/         # Validated API request/response models
└── tests/           # API contract and route tests
```

This is a guide, not a requirement to create empty folders now. Reuse the repository's existing framework and conventions before adding modules.

## Before implementation

1. Review `docs/development/VISHAL_ENGINEERING_CHECKLIST.md`.
2. Confirm the current approved API and WebSocket contracts with Niteshvar and Tharun.
3. Inspect the existing `thashu/` code and avoid duplicating robot-manager or hardware logic.
4. Add tests and update contract documentation with every interface change.
